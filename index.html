        <h2>Blaming Everybody</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Bob Sweeney:</strong> There was a moment, when I used to blame everything and everyone for all the pain and suffering and vile things that happened to me, that I saw happen to my people. Used to blame everybody. Blamed white people, blamed society, blamed God. I didn't get no answers 'cause I was asking the wrong questions. You have to ask the right questions.<br>
            <strong>Derek Vinyard:</strong> Like what?<br>
            <strong>Bob Sweeney:</strong> Has anything you've done made your life better?<br>
            <em>Our Answer:</em> Probably not, but check the code below:
        </p>
        <pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return 0;
}

        <h2>The Importance of Change</h2>
        <p>
            Change is hard, but it's essential. "Life is too short to be pissed off all the time. It's just not worth it."
            This idea is central to realizing the importance of growth and self-reflection.
